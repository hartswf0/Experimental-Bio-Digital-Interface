## Experimental Bio-Digital Interface

### Overview
The **Experimental Bio-Digital Interface** is an innovative project that merges biological concepts with digital technology, utilizing advanced graphics and interactivity to create a unique user experience. This interface employs a combination of 3D graphics, shaders, and real-time interactions to explore the boundaries between organic and digital forms.

### Features
- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Users can engage with a dynamic 3D scene featuring biomorphic hexagons that respond to mouse movements and touch inputs.
- **Custom Shaders**: The interface utilizes vertex and fragment shaders to create organic distortions and vibrant color transitions, enhancing the visual experience.
- **Responsive Behavior**: The hexagons exhibit reactive behaviors based on user interaction, including color mutations and movement patterns influenced by proximity to the mouse cursor.

### Technical Details
- **Framework**: Built using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Shaders**: Custom shaders are implemented for both vertex and fragment processing, allowing for complex visual effects such as organic movement and interference patterns.
- **User Interaction**: The interface captures mouse and touch events to modify the behavior of the visual elements in real-time.

### Installation
To run the Experimental Bio-Digital Interface locally:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebGL.

### Usage
Once loaded, users can interact with the hexagonal grid by moving their mouse or touching the screen, observing how the colors and shapes adapt dynamically.
